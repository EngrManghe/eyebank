1.	I want you to provide an electronic medical records, sepsis and transfusion data in this file as in a json format. using medical records, sepsis and blood transfusion as the keys
2.	I want you to memories this response as "eye bank data structure"
3.	show me eye bank data structure
4.	I want you to provide a medical records, sepsis and blood transfusion data in this file in a json format
